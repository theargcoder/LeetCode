well well, started by using a while loop that took O(N)
talk about shitty code right there

then realized that when i used std::pow() it took 100 ish micoseconds
that offended my 1920 MILLISECOND solution to its core so i went to 
wikepedia where i learned that we can do log(N) powers by squaring the base.....
I WAS OFFENDED, SAD and PISSED OFF at myself since i could've
probably
figured it out if I used excalidraw and some 10 minutes of brain power....
anyhow my solution is faster than the wikepedia bc i improved it

it divides by 2 using a bitwise shift of 1 bit to the RIGHT 
aka the in the direction of the LSB 
(if the convention is left = MSB and right = LSB) (whitch normal people use)

also removed the modulus operation to check if there was a bit at the end
and replaced it with a good old bitwise AND with the beloved 0x1
aka (00000000000000000000000001)
