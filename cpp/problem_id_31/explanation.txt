BROOOO my first submission was wrong because i assuemed that 
REPEATS were not ALLOWED, mfw they ended up been legal....
anyhow, altered the algo to account for repeats in any position,
this is a simple problem, we iterate until we find something
sorted in either ascending or descending order, form there if
its descending order we simply swap the last 2 values
THAT ARE NOT REPEATS (*boring...*) 
if they are in ascending order, we find the last element
greater than the previous position of begging of sorted section and 
we simply swap these and sort IN descending order form beegining of
the former ascending order sorted position till the end.
and VOILA it works......

out.
