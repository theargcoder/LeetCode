did a working but slow solution by cheatingISH (using a std::set<> lol)
hey but after some time figured out that the once the algo finds 
2 nums == on distinct positions, it continues BUT what took me long
to figure out to pass my test cases is how to tell it to continue 
with the combination given that because there was 2 == numbs in
the first or second iteration that doesnt mean that a valid permutation
can't be found there.... 
TOOK ME WAY TO LONG TO REALIZE I JUST NEEDED TO DO SOME SWAPING IN REVERSE

ANYHOW
