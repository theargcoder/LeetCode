proud of this one!!
hand crafted segfault by segfault

the algorithm is simple, it computes the "longest"
we can take by computing the current pos + the jump possible length.
if the current is the longest then we update the new position;
but we dont halt yet, we keep looking if in the range of the current
step we can find another longest (or equal to) step.
does so recursively until reaching the end.
