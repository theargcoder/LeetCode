well talk about a brute ass way of solving this lol
I had thought of doing it using the bisection methond aka 
binary search but didn't do it for some reason (i am lazy)

also since the biggest possible sqrt in a 32 bit int
is 43,340 then the maximum possible number of iterations
is just 43k which is not that much in a modern 3+ GHz 
proccessor..... 

but against log_2(2^32) (aka 32 maximum iterations) is eternal time.....
