well talk about overcomplicating things......
the funny thing is that my code esencially does the same
thing just with 100 extra steps.....
still fast, still works so not commplaining
will admit it took me a little longer than it should've

anyhow, we map sequencial pairs "()" as 0
"(" as a pending (to be matched) incremented
and ")" the pending # n was matched so decrease pending by 1
then we find the largest sequence of valid pendings and call it a day 
if (pending hits 0) we push any ")" as a -1 so we can delimit the sum
by those -1s 
all any number non zero has ofc a wheigh of 1 and 0's have weigh of 2.

overengineered... but i could parse my stuff their soulution only counts
(i think don't quote me not too sure)

out.
