so they call O(n) the same as O(k * n)
so BS i've read DATASTRUCTURES AND ALGO BOOKs
and I know in BIG O notation we drop constants
but FUCK OFF K is a big deal here....
specially since we are "comparing it" against
O(n * log n).
also its not O(n) memory its O(k * n)
not worth it.

POST:
  just for exercise I'll do a radix sort implementation
