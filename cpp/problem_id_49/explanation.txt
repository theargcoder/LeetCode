my face when I remembered that transposing a matrix is easy asf......
anyhow my solution is very elegant and super easy to understand
so we imagine a circle with layers, if you want to rotate it 90 deg
clockwise all the layers have to follow
so using std::swap we do a little cordinate system to keep swaping the layers
and voila
4 swaps per location in a layer, where a layer is nums[i].size()
and we do has nums[i].size() - 1 - depth of layers

interesting to think i was trying to transpose the matrix but 
my brain went otherwise.......
still a 0ms solution, no complicated looping or break statements
no memory usage at all literally 8 bytes and some change....
and std::swap that should use std::move

I will admit this method isnt the most efficient if you want to do more 
than rotate it...
