did 2 good solutions without using std::unordered_map.....
FORGOT THAT YOU CAN HASH A STRING LOLLLLLL
ANYHOW

much faster to use that instead of the manual O(n^2)
to compare every string/key.........

then using the unordered_map but instead of hashing the string
we hash the frecuency count of chars, since its sorted its easy to do
pretty fast about O(n) ish.
