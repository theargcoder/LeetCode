Initially my solution had complexity of O(n^3) witch was far too complex for it to even be
submit worthy...
After some googling found out about Manacherâ€™s Algorithm which is a way of solving this
problem with O(n) complexity....
Not going to lie the logic is kinda brutal...
I dont see this very applicable in any real world situation but here we are...

bye bye
