its always the most simple looking problems, that are the most tiresome.

anyhow, we use a state machine, we have 4 states, up, down, right, left
when we move from:
  right -> down we move our top wall down.
  down -> left we move our right wall left.
  left -> up we move our bottom wall up.
  up -> right we move our left wall right.
do this untill 2 walls collide then finish the row/column and done.
