good worked on first try
simple once i realized that that the problem states the Nth NODE 
FROM THE END NOT FROM THE HEAD i wasted like 30 minutes
trying to figure out why it didn't work LOL

simple enough just iterate n times until you reached the NODE
you want to delete and unlink it by making the prev point 
to the next one of the current.

out.
