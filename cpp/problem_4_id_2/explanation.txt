First submission did it.

Just a linked list nothing special.

both add_two_recursive and add_single_recursive are 
helper functions used to "traverse" the linked list

In the Leetcode solution they did the same thing in
a more compact way using ternary operators

but the complexity of my solution is still
"beats 100%" so just more verbose code where it 
could've been simpler.

nice.
