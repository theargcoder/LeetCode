simple solution....
pretty much same as word palindrome checking....
this is not the most efficeint way of doing it
I though about doing it arithmetically bit didn't 
reach a conclusion that i was sure that would work

once again if C had assembly level of bitwise control
I could BCD encode the number and do this in ~60 ish
cpu cycles.

This would be ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE faster than their
proposed solution since no division would take place
only double dabble algorithm.....

YOU KNOW WHAT I'll solve it in assembly (ARM 64)
just becuase i can.......
will be attached the main.asm file for the curious.
