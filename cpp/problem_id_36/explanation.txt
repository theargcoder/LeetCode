check both rows and columns on the first loop, using a buffer and string.find
of course if there are repeats we return false.
same with the 3x3 boards but the trick is in the math to get the actual 3x3 board.
the process is the same with a std::string buffer and string.find to validate the board

THIS USED TO BE:
    Average Execution Time: 2569 ns
    Duration in nano-seconds: 2263 ps
    Duration in microseconds: 2 µs

NOW UPDATED TO BE:
    Average Execution Time: 64 ns
    Duration in nano-seconds: 74 ps
    Duration in microseconds: 0 µs

AKA A LOT FASTER THANKS TO THE quest of getting the sudoku solver 
into the microseconds range, the uncommented version is the one that has
the perfect blend between: 
    memory (~14 bytes) 
    raw performance 320 ish nano-seconds
there is a faster version which uses ~470 Bytes of memory 
and on emptyish boards its in the 170 nano-second range
but i think its pointless due to the memory overhead and its minimal
benefit in full-ish boards
