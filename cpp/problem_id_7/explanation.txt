My computer engineering mind tried solving this by

1. converting the int to BCD
2. inversing the BCD (aka MSB = LSB until LSB = MSB) 
3. re signing the integer if it was negative
4. re-encoding the BCD into raw binary or 2's compliment
5. returning the re-encoded.

this solution would've worked if C let you do bit to bit comparasions
and comparing sections of the register like you can do in assembly or
verilog. 
This solution woulve been REALLY REALLY fast since its only 42
CPU cycles for the encoding, 14 for the inversing, and 14 for
the re-encoding into binary and an extra 1 for the case where input
is negative.

sadly couldn't figure out how to do this in C or C++...
