Algorithm is O(n)

Pushing into result is O(n) too I belive

making the overall complexity O(n^2)

weridly enugh not initializing the strings in the 
loop were the array "container" gets pushed the first 
i chars (limited by numrows) makes this 300% slower
No clue why, my theory is that since string "temp_str"
is created in the stack of the loop, this one gets
overwritten and no need of constructor
Assuming that the compiler is doing GOD
level optimizations.....

Also using std::move in the last loop makes it also 1-3 ms 
slower IDK why..... no clue;

anyways pretty simple problem peace out
