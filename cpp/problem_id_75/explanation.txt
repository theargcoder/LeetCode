I was thinking of doing some strange mege-sort kinda deal
but then I remembered that this was as simple as counting how many
instances of red, white and blue (AMERICAAAAAA!!!!! (eagle noises))
and then re fill (reusing memory of the given vector) and done.

taking O(n * 2)
witch is more time efficient when n > 100 than merge sort !!!
