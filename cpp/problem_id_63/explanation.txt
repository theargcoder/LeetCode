I love it when you learn discrete math theory for nothing 
since there isn't much practical aplications to simple path counting
I had a working soulution but it explored every path over and over again
very slow

now the other solution does the same but without doing any recalculation.
since we traverse the "graph" in a 2D fashion no point in storing the above
rows calculation, thus only needing n space instead of n*m space
In terms of logic we just keep adding the previous path count to the current 
recursively, similar to Mr Fibonacci's sequence; what makes it different
its the following line;


                  'dp[0] = grid[i][0] ? 0 : dp[0];'

and some more details.
