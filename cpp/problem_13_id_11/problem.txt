11. COntainer With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

|8|       o                  o
|7|       o                  o       o
|6|       o   o              o       o
|5|       o   o      o       o       o
|4|       o   o      o   o   o       o
|3|       o   o      o   o   o   o   o
|2|       o   o   o  o   o   o   o   o
|1|       o   o   o  o   o   o   o   o
|0|   o   o   o   o  o   o   o   o   o


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
