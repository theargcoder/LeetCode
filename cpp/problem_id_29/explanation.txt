"BRUH, THE FASTEST SOLUTION USES A FKING 
MULTIPLICATION TO FLIP THE SIGN. 
THE PROBLEM LITERALLY STATES:
'Divide two integers without using 
multiplication, division, or mod operator.'
GTFO OF HERE.**

Regardless, doing logical arithmetic in C/C++ 
is HORRIBLE since it's designed 
SO THE USER CAN AVOID WRITING BIT BY BIT LOGICAL OPERATIONS
Ever heard of the term...? 'human-readable assembly.'

Verilog is superior for this kind of stuff.
Will admit, in assembly I could do this way simpler too...

REGARDLESS, my solution took 19 business days instead of 0 ms...
But hey, it works...
LOL.
