talk about the most BS error in my life on my first submission....
THE ALGO WORKED LIKE MAGIC, PERFECTLY
but a INT_MAX + INT_MAX caused overflow....... so it told me to 
fuck off...........
GTFO like cmon bruh, anyhow, should've though of that testcase..
my fault....

anyhow, its the same thing as 3 sum just with a combination of the 
logic for the closest 3 sum thingy, easy ngl....
bye.
