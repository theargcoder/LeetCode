bruh on my first submition i got a nasty 
runtime error because of an uninitialized int (named 'max')
anyhow, not the best solution since it takes O(n^2) vs the
proposed 0 ms solution that takes O(n), but in my defense,
my solution is MEMORY EFFICIENT ASF;
pretty interesting solution they propose in the 0m ssubmition 

still proud of it even if it takes for ever to do this!!
