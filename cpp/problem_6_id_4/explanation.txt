Divide and conquer algorithm but adapted to our specific case (medians)

Now this is the fastest possible way of solving this problem

Way way faster than the fastest proposed soulution by leetcode.
Which has space O(n+m) time complexity 

This divide and conquer solution has complexity of (O(log(min(n,m))))

Therefore in massive arrays would make a massive difference.

Proud of this solution, but it took me like a Day!!!
