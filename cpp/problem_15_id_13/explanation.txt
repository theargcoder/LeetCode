pretty clean solution
took me like 10 mins to realize my initial approach was WAY too complex
it eventually clicked
Don't do leetcode problems after studing 11 hours......
No bueno

Regardless my solution has O(n) time complexity
Very nice and redable, unlike some of the leetcode proposed solutions.... 
(yes thats me hating btw)
the proposed fastest solution is kinda ugly and too many switch statemets
for my liking.

Kudos !!
