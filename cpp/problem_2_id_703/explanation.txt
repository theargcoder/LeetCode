We save the value of the count "k" in a private integer for later use.

We copy the vectory and sort it.

then when adding an int we use lower_bound to find the iterator thats greater than "val"

then insert in that position val

and finally we return the k position of the gratest to smallest sorted array



WHY ITS INEFICIENT

I didnt know std::priority_queue was even a thing.... LOL

this is the perfect class to contain and solve this kind of problem due to the automatic sorting in insertion and O(1) access complexity.

welll.... next time will have it as an option....
